# Raspberry-Pi-Shield board

We've designed a Raspberry Pi Shield PCB. The aim of this board is to add a board on top of the Raspberry which would be connected by the latter with a female connector to the male connector of the Raspberry.
The aim of our shield card is to add new functionality to the Raspberry Pi, in particular an analog part that the Raspberry Pi didn't contain. That's why we've added an analog-to-digital converter, which will be connected to a temperature sensor, a potentiometer and a photoresistor.

<h1> Electronic diagram</h1>
The PCB is a two-layer construction. It measures 6.5 cm x 3.3cm. This is half the width of the Raspberry Pi board. Our shield board will be held in place by the female connector and the two holes located in front of the Raspberry Pi board for easy attachment.

<h1>PCB Design</h1>

The PCB has been realized on Altium Designer. The PCB has been realized on Altium Designer.The PCB consists of two layers, Top Layer and Bottom Layer. We've added a female connector to connect our shield card to the Raspberry Pi.  
The PCB is half the size of the Raspberry Pi 4 board, so it will now be screwed to the two holes and the female connector.
In the middle of the board you'll find the analog-to-digital converter, which converts the value of our potentiometer, temperature sensor and photoresistor.
On the digital side, you'll find the remote control's push-button and infrared sensor:
